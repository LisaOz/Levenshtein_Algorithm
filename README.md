# Levenshtein Distance Algorithm

This script calculates the **Levenshtein distance** (edit distance) between two strings.
The Levenshtein distance measures the minimum number of single-character edits
(insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to change one string into another.

## Features
- Computes the edit distance between two strings provided by the user.
- Uses dynamic programming for efficient calculation.

## Usage
1. **Input**: Enter two words or strings when prompted.
2. **Output**: The output will display the minimum edit distance between the two strings.

## Installation
Clone the repository or download the script file.

## Running the Script
Run the script using Python: python main.py
